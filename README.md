**_Cartoonify Image using PYTHON_**
**OpenCV**
OpenCV is an open-source Python library used mainly for computer vision tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, OpenCV is playing a major role in the field of technology. Using OpenCV, we can process images and videos for tasks like object detection, face detection, object tracking, and more.
OpenCV has c, c++, java, and Python interfaces and it supports all kinds of systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, Mac OS, IoS, and all…
**Requirements**
**Python**: We use Python as a programming language for building the application.
**cv2:** We use cv2 for image processing.
**Numpy:** Mainly NumPy is used for dealing with arrays. Here the images that we use are stored in the form of arrays. So for that, we use NumPy.
**Easygui:** Easygui is a module used for GUI programming in Python. In our application easygui is used to open the file box to upload images from the local system.
**Imageio:** Imageio is a Python library that reads and writes the images.
**Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is used for visualization purposes. Here we plot the images using matplotlib.
**OS:** Here in our application os is used for dealing with paths like reading images from the path and saving the image to the path.
**Tkinter:** Tkinter is a standard Graphical User Interface(GUI) package.


**__Sports car prediction ___**

As sports fans, we all love to predict the outcome of games. Whether it’s the Super Bowl, the World Cup, or the NBA Finals, we eagerly analyze team performance, player statistics, and other factors to try to guess who will come out on top. But what if we could use data science to make more accurate predictions? In this article, we’ll explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the outcome of sports events, and we’ll provide some code examples to illustrate the process.

One of the most common approaches to predicting sports outcomes is supervised learning, a type of machine learning algorithm that uses labeled data to train a model. In the case of sports prediction, the labeled data might include historical records of game outcomes, along with data about the teams, players, and other relevant factors.

To illustrate this approach, let’s look at a simple example using the scikit-learn library in Python. Suppose we want to predict the outcome of a basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors. We might start by gathering historical data on previous games between these two teams, along with information about the players, the venue, and other factors. We could then use this data to train a machine-learning model to predict the game's outcome.
